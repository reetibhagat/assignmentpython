# 2. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
# their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
# Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
#     HINT - Use Zip function also
# Sample input: students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
# Expected output: {‘Smit’ : ’CSE’ , ’Jaya’ : ’Networking’ , ’Rayyan’ : ’Operating System’}
